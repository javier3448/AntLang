@TODO SOON:
Write the maximum length of a string representation of QbeOperand in a constant 
BE MINDFUL OF THE MAX LENGTH OF QBE CONSTANTS TOO

@TODO:
write a macro that asserts something and prints a message when the assertion fails.
this would be a good excercise to learn a more about c macros

@TODO:
Use templates or whatnot to make a malloc that is easier to use, so I dont have to
write the type like 3 times everytime I use malloc

@Improvement?????:
Abbreviate Expression to expr through out all the 'codebase'

@TODO:
Make a templated version of dynamic array that has no constructor or destructor.
It doesnt have to be great or let the user define allocators or resizing 
parameters. I just want to be able to progress and see what works and what doesnt
before having to think about a proper 'allocation strategy'

@TODO: 
Get rid of all constructors, just use functions from now on:
MyObj construct(construct params...);
or
void construct(MyObj* obj, construct params...);

@TODO much much much later on:
Decide which asserts are worth keeping in release build (most of them seem
quite cheap so I wouldn't mind the perf hit) We might have to write our own
assert macro if we want to do that

@TODO quality of life improvement: the readability of the double literals in 
the our current qbe ir generation is way too bad, find way to improve it

A lot of the problems we are having with strings is that we want 1 struct to 
perfectly work with everything we do. There is no need for that. We can have
some strings be null terminated, others have length s64 or even s32

If the identifier fo a temporal can only has a staticaly know max length
why couldn't we store the name in the struct instead of having a MyString that
has a heap pointer

@TODO: Should we have a guy that goes thru the AST and generates both LLVM and 
Qbe at the same time?
For now just generate qbe
