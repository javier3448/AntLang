@TODO:
write a macro that asserts something and prints a message when the assertion fails.
this would be a good excercise to learn a more about c macros

@TODO:
Use templates or whatnot to make a malloc that is easier to use, so I dont have to
write the type like 3 times everytime I use malloc

@Improvement?????:
Abbreviate Expression to expr through out all the 'codebase'

@TODO:
Make a templated version of dynamic array that has no constructor or destructor.
It doesnt have to be great or let the user define allocators or resizing 
parameters. I just want to be able to progress and see what works and what doesnt
before having to think about a proper 'allocation strategy'

@TODO: 
Get rid of all constructors, just use functions from now on:
MyObj construct(construct params...);
or
void construct(MyObj* obj, construct params...);
