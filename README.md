I am just trying to understand how do programming languages work by making one.
It aims to a C like language with minor improvements like: no headers, better 
numeric constants, type inference, and templates.

It is still in its early days, barely a parser right now.

The name is just temporary, this project is not related with any other 
AntLang out there in the wild.
